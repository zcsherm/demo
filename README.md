# Statistics Class Helper
  This simple python program aims to provide an interactive environment for students in statistics class to experiment and develop an intuition for various common distributions. The program is extensible and allows any user to create continuous distributions using arbitrary functions, or to extend existing classes into new distributions.

# Features
  - Built in objects for the most common distributions, such as the Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, and more
  - Built in methods for common manipulations for these models, such as cumulative density and percentile finding
  - High level descriptions of each distribution
  - Help features to guide students in selecting the appropriate model for new problems
  - An interactive environment that allows students to manipulate each model wih ease

# To-do
  - Add GUI elements that interact with underlying models
  - ~~Add cdf for arbitrary continuous functions using sympy.integrate~~ -> potentially develop own integrate function?
  - Add methods for variance and expected value of continuous variables
  - Add method that plots a given function
  - Add method that colors in plots based on passed cdf values
  - Add help features
  - ~~Add model for discrete, non-formulaic, probability tables~~
  - Add model for set theory probabilities (P(A),P(B),P(B or A),P(A|B), etc)
  - Add the following models:
    - Uniform distribution
    - Gamma distribution
    - Chi squared
    - Exponential distribution
    - Normal distribution
    - Standard Normal
  - Add Z-tables
  - Add images for functions or LaTex for functions?
  - Add descriptions of each variable and examples
  - ~~Add ability to create samples~~
  - ~~Add Z and T testing sample sets and general functions, both for proportion and quantitative variables~~
  - ~~Add confidence interval functions for samples~~
  - Add experiments with multiple samples
  - Add ability to perform ANOVA, matched T, 2 t test analysis
  - Add Linear Regression model
  - Add t testing for LR model (slope and intercept)
