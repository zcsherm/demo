# Statistics Class Helper
  This simple python program aims to provide an interactive environment for students in statistics class to experiment and develop an intuition for various common distributions. The program is extensible and allows any user to create continuous distributions using arbitrary functions, or to extend existing classes into new distributions.

# Features
  -Built in objects for the most common distributions, such as the Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, and more
  -Built in methods for common manipulations for these models, such as cumulative density and percentile finding
  -High level descriptions of each distribution
  -Help features to guide students in selecting the appropriate model for new problems
  -An interactive environment that allows students to manipulate each model wih ease
